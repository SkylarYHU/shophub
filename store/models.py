      Let's say a customer orders 3 units of a product called "Laptop" and 2 units of a product called "Mouse."

          One for the "Laptop" with a quantity of 3.
          Another for the "Mouse" with a quantity of 2.
      Both OrderItem objects would reference the same Order object, representing the entire transaction for the customer.
